Im watching videos from "programming with mosh"  which is a course for learning python.

WEEK 1: learning variables by watching an hour of examples and explanations 
There are problems that are given to practice variables which include: writing a code that includes a checking in a patient named John Smith, who is 20 years old and is a new patient. 

solution to example:
full_name = 'John Smith'
age = 20
is_new = True

WEEK 2: leanred how print statements worked. Watched how Mosh did his exmaples and explanations.
The problem that came with this section was: Ask two questions: person's name and favorite color. The print a message like "Mosh likes blue"

solution to the problem:
name = input('What is your name? ')
favorite_color = input('What is your favorite color? ')
print(name + ' likes ' + favorite_color)

WEEK 3: learning how type conversions and strings work. Watched about an hour of explanations and example problems.
The problem this week is : The price of a house is $1m. If the buyer has good credit, they need to put down 10%, Otherwise they need to put down 20%, print the down payment.

solution to the problem:
price = 1000000
has_good_credit = True

if has_good_credit:
    down_payment = 0.1 * price
else:
    down_payment = o.2 * price
print(f"Down payment: ${down_payment}")

WEEK 4: learning about how logical operators work and comparison operators work. Spent 45 minuets watching examples from Mosh.
The problem for this section was: if name is less than 3 characters long, name must be at least 3 characters, otherwise is it's more than 50 characters long then name can be a maximum of 50 characters, otherwise name looks good!

soltion to the problem:
name = 'John Smith'

if len(name) < 3:
    print("Name must be at least 3 characters.")
elif len(name) > 50:
    print("Name must be a maximum of 50 characters.")
else:
    print("Name looks good!")
    
WEEK 5: watched videos and examples that explained how lists work in python. About an hour spent listening and watching examples.
The problem for lists was: write a program to find the largest number in a list.

solution to the problem:
numbers = [3, 6, 2, 10, 8, 4]
max = numbers[0]
for number in numbers:
    if number > max:
        max = number
print(max)

WEEK 6: This week I learned about classes in Python. He showed examples of how classes are used to define new types.
Problem for the class: Define a new type called Person, should include name and talk()

solution to the problem:
Class Person:
   def_init_(self, name):
      self.name = name
      
   def talk(self):
       print(f"Hi, I am {self.name}
       
john = person("John Smith")
john.talk()

WEEK 7: I learned more about how to deal with lists. He went more into depth about how they work and showed examples of how they work.
Problem for this week: Write a program that removes the duplicates in a list.

Solution:

numbers = [2, 2, 4, 6, 3, 4, 6, 1]
uniques = []
for number in numbres:
    if number not in uniques:
        uniques.append(number)
print(uniques)

WEEK 8: This week I was watches mosh explain how while loops work and examples to go with them. It really helped me understand more about how they work
Problem: Write a program that makes a guessing game and the number you are supposed to guess is 9.
 
 Solution: 
 secret_number = 9
 guess_count = 0
 guess_limit = 3
 while guess_count < guess_limit:
      guess = int(input('Guess: ')
      guess_count += 1
      if guess == secret_number:
         print('You Won!')
         
WEEK 9: I learned how methods work and how to generate random values. Watched him explain how they work and write a program that generated random names.

Problem: Create a program that can roll a dice.

Solution:

import random

class Dice:
   def roll(self):
       first = random.randint(1, 6)
       second = random.randint(1, 6)
       return first, second 
       
       
 dice = Dice
 print(dice.roll())
 
 WEEK 10: This week mosh was explaining why dictionaries are so important in python and why they should be used. He showed examples of how to put words in the 'dictionary".
 
 Problem: Translate Phone: 1234 so it actually prints "one" "two" "three" "four"
 
 Solution:
 
 phone = input("Phone: ")
 digits_mapping = {
     "1": "One",
     "2": "Two",
     "3": "Three",
     "4": "Four"
 }
 for ch in phone:
     output += digits_mapping.get(ch, "!") + " "
 ptint(output)
 
 WEEK 11: I was still leanring about dictionaries, but we did something pretty cool this week. He showed me how to do emojiis in python by giving examples and explaining well.
 
 Problem: Translate :) into the emojii smiley face "😃"
 
 Solution: 
 
 message = input(">")
 words = message.split(' ')
 emoji = {
     ":)": "😃"
}
output = ""
for word in words:
    emoji.get(word, word)
    
WEEK 12: This week in Python we learned how constructors work in python. Most did an example of how they work, when to use then, and mistakes that could be possible.
  
Problem: Define a new type called "Person". This person object should have a name attribute as well as a talk method.  

Solution: 

class Person:
    def_init_(self, name):
       self.name = name
       
    def talk(self):
        print(f"Hi, I am {self.name}")


sam = person("Sam Huber")
sam.talk()

alayna = person("Alayna Alberts")
alayna.talk()
