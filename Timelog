Im watching videos from "programming with mosh"  which is a course for learning python.

WEEK 1: learning variables by watching an hour of examples and explanations 
There are problems that are given to practice variables which include: writing a code that includes a checking in a patient named John Smith, who is 20 years old and is a new patient. 

solution to example:
full_name = 'John Smith'
age = 20
is_new = True

WEEK 2: leanred how print statements worked. Watched how Mosh did his exmaples and explanations.
The problem that came with this section was: Ask two questions: person's name and favorite color. The print a message like "Mosh likes blue"

solution to the problem:
name = input('What is your name? ')
favorite_color = input('What is your favorite color? ')
print(name + ' likes ' + favorite_color)

WEEK 3: learning how type conversions and strings work. Watched about an hour of explanations and example problems.
The problem this week is : The price of a house is $1m. If the buyer has good credit, they need to put down 10%, Otherwise they need to put down 20%, print the down payment.

solution to the problem:
price = 1000000
has_good_credit = True

if has_good_credit:
    down_payment = 0.1 * price
else:
    down_payment = o.2 * price
print(f"Down payment: ${down_payment}")

WEEK 4: learning about how logical operators work and comparison operators work. Spent 45 minuets watching examples from Mosh.
The problem for this section was: if name is less than 3 characters long, name must be at least 3 characters, otherwise is it's more than 50 characters long then name can be a maximum of 50 characters, otherwise name looks good!

soltion to the problem:
name = 'John Smith'

if len(name) < 3:
    print("Name must be at least 3 characters.")
elif len(name) > 50:
    print("Name must be a maximum of 50 characters.")
else:
    print("Name looks good!")
    
WEEK 5: watched videos and examples that explained how lists work in python. About an hour spent listening and watching examples.
The problem for lists was: write a program to find the largest number in a list.

solution to the problem:
numbers = [3, 6, 2, 10, 8, 4]
max = numbers[0]
for number in numbers:
    if number > max:
        max = number
print(max)

WEEK 6: This week I learned about classes in Python. He showed examples of how classes are used to define new types.
Problem for the class: Define a new type called Person, should include name and talk()

solution to the problem:
Class Person:
   def_init_(self, name):
      self.name = name
      
   def talk(self):
       print(f"Hi, I am {self.name}
       
john = person("John Smith")
john.talk()

WEEK 7: I learned more about how to deal with lists. He went more into depth about how they work and showed examples of how they work.
Problem for this week: Write a program that removes the duplicates in a list.

Solution:

numbers = [2, 2, 4, 6, 3, 4, 6, 1]
uniques = []
for number in numbres:
    if number not in uniques:
        uniques.append(number)
print(uniques)

WEEK 8: This week I was watches mosh explain how while loops work and examples to go with them. It really helped me understand more about how they work
Problem: Write a program that makes a guessing game and the number you are supposed to guess is 9.
 
 Solution: 
 secret_number = 9
 guess_count = 0
 guess_limit = 3
 while guess_count < guess_limit:
      guess = int(input('Guess: ')
      guess_count += 1
      if guess == secret_number:
         print('You Won!')
