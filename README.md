# Python
My goal is to learn Python for Everybody.
The Boudaries will be Watch videos to learn Python, Complete Course 1 Programming for Everybody,Complete Course 2 Python Data Structure.
The success criteria will be weekly logins showing what I did for learning Python.
The contraints I will have will be auditing the course for free so will be able to read and view the course content but not submit projects or earn the certification.
My assumption is the course will be available for me to use, to help me learn python, I have all the required software, I will not have to pay for the course.
The stakeholders are: My professor - for a grade, parents - to be successful and make them proud, future emplyees - to contribute and make a buisness successful, my friends - to help them be successful as well as me.
This will be the Timeline. It will be weekly.
